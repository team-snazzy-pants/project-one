      <h2>Business Constraints not covered by Design</h2>
      <ul>
        <h5>There is no relationship between StaffMember or Client</h5>
        <li>If a StaffMember is also a Client there is no mapping to indicate this relationship</li>
        <li>Relationships only exist between Property and Client or Client and Listing Agent</li>
      </ul>
      <p>After some debate, we opted to not model a relationship between staff member and client to keep from getting bogged down in minutia and to keep the model from becoming unnecessarily complex.  Our model was already becoming quite complex without this relationship.</p>

      <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzF6yPUde9YqMUdIV3EtV1VHc28/view?usp=sharing">see draw.io for relationalDiagram</a>
      <ul>
        <li>We modeled N:M relationships with the relationship relation / cross-reference option.  We created a separate relation and used the primary keys of the entities modeled as foreign keys.</li>
        <li>We modeled inheritance with StaffMember and its child classes sellingAgent and listingAgent.  We created separate relations for the superclass and the two subclasses.</li>
        <li>We also modeled inheritance with client and its child classes buyer, renter and owner.  We created separate relations for the superclass and the three subclasses.</li>
        <li>We did not have any ternary relationships.</li>
        <li>We mapped multi-attribute attributes using a separate relation.  Each has a foreign key of its entity and a combined primary key of the foreign key plus an attribute of the multi-valued entity.</li>
        <li>There were no constraints that were represented in ER design, but could not be mapped to the relational design.</li>
        <li>One design choice we made was to use inheritance to model StaffMember.  This makes it easy to quickly understand the soldBy and listedBy relationships for StaffMember. Information gained by this design choice was commission attribute on each child class. This could be modeled more simply without inheritance, but it would be harder to quickly understand.</li>
        <li>Another design choice we made was to use inheritance to model Client.  This makes it easy to quickly understand the buyer, renter and owner subclasses. These could be modelled using attributes but this method is more clear</li>
